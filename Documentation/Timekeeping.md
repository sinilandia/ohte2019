# Timekeeping

| date | time | what did I do  |
| :----:|:-----| :-----|
| 21.3. | 3    | Reading through the material and exploring possible topics. Researching how and where to get weather API, how to build a Telegram bot, etc. |
| 24.3. | 1.5  | Wrote [Software requirements specification documentation](https://github.com/sinilandia/ohte2019/blob/master/Documentation/Srs.md). |
| 30.3  | 4.5  | Initial code for keeping tabs on raids and some tests |
| 4.3.  | 1    | Trying to (again) troubleshoot my double folder problem: DidIRaidThat and Didiraidthat. The first one includes only pom.xml and the latter all the code. When course perssonel clones my repo, they get both folders. When I clone my repo, I only get one. I don't know how to get rid of the other folder. Will troubleshoot at paja later this week. | 
| 9.4.  | 1.5    | Fixed my github - netbeans - folder naming issue. |  
| 9.4.  | 1.0    | Added package structure. Changed package names to start with a small letter, per instructions. For some reason the change didn't reflect in Netbeans and once again this resulted in a naming issue. So had to change everything back and for now, live with incorrect package names. |  
| 9.4.  | 2.5    | Drew package diagram. Added checkstyle (but didn't fix all the 100+ errors that the report gave me). |  
| 13.4. | 1.0    | Added GitHub issues from settings, read theory and code for reference application [OtmTodoApp](https://github.com/mluukkai/OtmTodoApp).| 
| 14.4  | 1.0  | Trying to understand why you need new File in FileWriter constructor, e.g. FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(**new File(file)**) instead of FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(**file)**. I still don't know. |
| 14.4  | 0.5  | Refactor and create classes Gym and Raid. |
| 16.6  | 7.5  | Researching more about FileWriter constructor and error handling. Got a reply in Telegram. Now I know that you don't need a new File in FileWriter constructor. Refactoring. Added jar-file generation. Added DAO classes. Added RaidService and Raidui. Added skipped_files.xml for checkstyle. Fixed checkstyle errors. Added tests. Added one sequence diagram. |
